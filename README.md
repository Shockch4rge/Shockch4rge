## Hi there, I'm Favian.

I'm not a very interesting person, but here's what I love about my life:

**🎸 MUSIC!** 

I play the classical/acoustic guitar, and a sprinkle of piano. Music's often my go-to when the day gets long and/or boring. A few of my favourite modern musicians are Lisa Hannigan, Gregory Alan Isakov and CHVRCHES, in that order :) And I'm a huge fan of the oldies: Chopin, Lizst and Augustin Barrios; to name a few.

**⚙️ TECH!** 

When I'm not immersing myself in music, I'm adept with new technology/secrets/tips/languages/hoo-ha that spring up from time to time. Be it software or hardware, I'm always on the lookout for new breakthroughs in the ever-growing and adapting environment which is tech.

**🎮 GAMING!** 

At the end of the day, I might just wind down for a few hours of gaming. Well, not as much as I did a few years ago, but I still enjoy when they are well-constructed and enjoyable. One of my absolute favourites is Far Cry 5; love its open-world design!

## My programming language proficiency 📖
Like all languages, be it communicating with people or talking to really stupid machines, learning them is hard.
Here's what I've been exposed to, and what I think about them:
- **Python** 🐍 (great language for beginners and general use; pretty difficult syntax - at least for me)
- **Java** ☕ (incredible language to introduce OOP; really ancient - and too many words!)
- **JavaScript** 🔨 (the basic foundation of the web; crazy annoying loose typing and weird syntax) 
- **TypeScript** ⬆️ (upgraded JavaScript in every way; it's pretty good)
- *and many more to come...*

My favourite language? Hard to say. I'm not a very opinionated developer. But I do have my likes and dislikes.

## What I've made ✅
- **BitJam Music Player** (Java, Android)

A really primitive music player for Android systems. Built for a school project. *(here's hoping I get an A for it lol)*

## What I'm working on 🛠️
- **BitJam Music Bot** (TypeScript, Discord)

An even less versatile music player, but I'm still grasping the fundamentals of using APIs.
