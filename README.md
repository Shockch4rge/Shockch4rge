## Hi there, I'm Favian.

I'm 17, and I live in Singapore. I'm not a very interesting person. But here's some stuff that I like:

**üé∏ MUSIC!** 

I play the classical/acoustic guitar, and a sprinkle of piano. Music's often my go-to when the day gets long and/or boring. A few of my favourite modern musicians are Lisa Hannigan, Gregory Alan Isakov and CHVRCHES, in that order :) And I'm a huge fan of the oldies: Chopin, Lizst and Augustin Barrios; to name a few.

**‚öôÔ∏è TECH!** 

When I'm not immersing myself in music, I'm adept with new technology/secrets/tips/languages/hoo-ha that spring up from time to time. Be it software or hardware, I'm always on the lookout for new breakthroughs in the ever-growing and adapting environment of technology.

**üéÆ GAMING!** 

At the end of the day, I might just wind down for a few hours of gaming. Well, not as much as I did a few years ago, but I am still very critical of well-constructed and enjoyable games. One of my absolute favourites is Far Cry 5; love its open-world design!

## My programming language proficiency üìñ
Like all languages, be it communicating with people or talking to really stupid machines, learning them is hard.
Here's what I've been exposed to, and what I think about them:
- **Python** üêç (great language for beginners and general use // pretty difficult syntax - at least for me)
- **Java** ‚òï (incredible language to introduce OOP // really ancient - and too verbose!)
- **JavaScript** üî® (the basic foundation of the web // crazy annoying loose typing and weird syntax) 
- **TypeScript** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (upgraded JavaScript in every way // it's pretty good)
- **Solidity** (WIP)
- *and many more to come...*

My favourite language? Hard to say. I'm not a very opinionated developer. But I do have my likes and dislikes. It's still too early for me to judge!

## What I've made ‚úÖ
- [**java-android-bitjam**] (Java, Android) - A music player for Android.
- [**ts-discord-bittrivia**] (TypeScript, Discord) - A bot that asks random questions with every message sent, randomly.

A really primitive music player for Android systems. Built for a school project. *(Edit: I got a distinction!)*
