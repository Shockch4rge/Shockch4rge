## Hi there, I'm Favian.

I'm 18, and I live in Singapore. I'm not a very interesting person. But here's some stuff that I like:

**üé∏ MUSIC!** 

I play the classical/acoustic guitar, and a sprinkle of piano. Music's often my go-to when the day gets long and/or boring. A few of my favourite modern musicians are Lisa Hannigan, Gregory Alan Isakov and CHVRCHES, in that order :) And I'm a huge fan of the oldies: Chopin, Lizst and Augustin Barrios; to name a few.

**‚öôÔ∏è TECH!** 

When I'm not immersing myself in music, I'm adept with new technology, languages, (*~and 10 new JS frameworks~*) that spring up from time to time. Be it software or hardware, I'm always on the lookout for new breakthroughs in the ever-growing and adapting environment of technology.

**üéÆ GAMING!** 

At the end of the day, I might just wind down for a few hours of gaming. Well, not as much as I did a few years ago, but I am still very critical of well-constructed and enjoyable games. One of my absolute favourites is Far Cry 5; love its open-world design!

## My programming language proficiency üìñ
I love to expose myself to the quirks of languages when I have time. Here's what I'm comfortable with so far:
- **Python** üêç
- **Java** ‚òï
- **JavaScript** üî®
- **TypeScript** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
- **PHP** (WIP)
- **React** (WIP)
- **Rust** (WIP)
- **Dart (Flutter)** (WIP)
- *and many more to come...*

My favourite language? Hard to say. I'm not a very opinionated developer. Though I have my likes and dislikes, it's still too early for me to judge!

## What I've made ‚úÖ
- [**java-android-bitjam**] (Java, Android) - A music player for Android.

- [**ts-discord-bittrivia**] (TypeScript, Discord) - A bot that sends a random question and awaits an answer.

- [**ts-discord-bitjam**] (TypeScript, Discord) - A music bot for Discord.

- [**react-redux-findmyfood**] (React.ts, Redux Toolkit) - A restaurant lookup and review website.

- [**djs-message-commands**] (TypeScript, Discord) - An npm package to facilitate creating and handling message commands in Discord.

## What I'm working on üõ†Ô∏è
- [**react-goodtalk**], [**node-websocket-goodtalk**] (React, Node) - A basic chat app built with Redux and WebSockets.

- [**ts-discord-bitjam-v2**] (TypeScript, Discord) - An enhanced version of [**ts-discord-bitjam**] as it was pretty slow and the code was messy.
